# Output Variable

## Non-Technical Description
An output variable is where the results from one task are stored so they can be used in the next task. In Magic Loops, place a dollar sign ($) before the variable name so the computer knows it is a variable, not plain text. An example is $TIME_BLOCK_OUTPUT.

## Technical Description
An output variable stores the result of a block or loop execution, allowing for the transfer of data between blocks or for use in subsequent tasks within a workflow.
