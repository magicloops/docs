  ## Non-Technical Description
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to format data so that it can be easily sent and read by computers. It looks like text but is structured in a specific way that computers can understand.
  
  ## Technical Description
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that uses human-readable text to represent structured data as key-value pairs. It is language-independent but primarily based on JavaScript syntax, making it easy to parse and generate in many programming languages.
